# TinyAgent

TinyAgent is a minimalistic AI agent written in Go. Its sole purpose is to provide a playground for experimenting with foundational models rapidly.

It should act as a boilerplate template meant to be cloned and customized for your needs.

## Features

An AI agent at the core could be defined by following equation:

```shell

Agent = Model + Loop + Tools

```

To keep things simple, TinyAgent will use Gemini as the foundation model because it offers a generous free tier and is very fast and very cheap.
